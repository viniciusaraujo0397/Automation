# Automation
To run the automation you will need an interactive terminal for this I recommend CMDER.

You will need Python 3, robot framework and selenium installed on the desktop for use.
https://www.python.org/
Use python to install selenium library and robot framework in terminal.

pip install selenium
pip install robotframework

Once installed, you can run it from the terminal using the commands:
robot -d ./log (File name)
NOTE: The base.robot file is the configuration file for the main Keywords inside the test is used for resource, without the need to run.
NOTE: Check if the chrome webdriver version is the latest compatible with your chrome browser.
If necessary, download a new version from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/.
